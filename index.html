<h1>WHO IS SHE?</h1>
<h2>Currently:&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Jennifer Casillas. I've been in Albuquerque for 2 years, and before that was in Austin for 15 years. I am working on getting my Bachelors in Liberal Arts. I started college back in the mid 2000's, but never finished. So I decided to take advantage of the Opportunity Scholarship and finally finish my degree at 40 years old. I am an Administrative Coordinator at the College of Pharmacy here at UNM, and I really enjoy working here. I am not majoring in anything specific, as I really love what I do in the administrative world. My hope is to take courses that I find interesting to gain more knowledge and add to my skillset. I know having a degree will give me more opportunities for growth here at UNM, as well as a sense of accomplishment knowing I finally completed something I started 20 years ago.</p>
<h2>Way Back When:</h2>
<p2>I grew up in Panama City, FL. In high school I was really interested in Journalism. I was part of the school newspaper, working my way up from Staff Writer to Section Editor, and eventually Editor in Chief my senior year. I also did an internship at the local newspaper my senior year. There I got to learn how to use QuarkXPress to layout articles and advertisements, and even had one of my articles published in the paper. After I graduated, I moved to Tallahassee, where I freelanced for the local paper there for about a year.</p2>
